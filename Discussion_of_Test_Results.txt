Discussion of Test Results

To test the program, the commands:
    - insert
    - delete
    - sum
    - average
    - min
    - median
will be verified

All tests will start from a newly started client each time.
Test cases have been created for each test and the inputs and
outputs and expected outputs have been described. Below are the 
test case definitions and their test results.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Verify Insert:

To verify that insert works as expected, we verify that:
    - TEST 1: insert adds an element when # elements < 98
    - TEST 2: insert throws and handles error when # elements >= 98

---
TEST 1:
    COMMANDS: insert 6, sum 

Input: insert 6
Output: Inserted 6
Expected: Inserted 6

Input: sum
Output: Sum is 6
Expected: Sum is 6

---
TEST 2:
    COMMANDS: sum, (insert 1) x 98, insert 1
    ...

Insert works as expected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Verify Delete:

To verify that delete works as expected, we verify that:
    - TEST 3: delete throws and handles an error when # elements < 1
    - TEST 4: delete deletes element k when # elements >= 1 and there 
        is 1 occurrence
    - TEST 5: delete deletes element k when # elements >= 1 and there
        are more than 1 occurrences

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Verify Sum:

To verify that sum works as expected, we will verify that:
    - TEST 6: sum gives correct value for 1 element 
    - TEST 7: sum gives correct value for multiple elements
    - TEST 8: sum throws and handles error when there are no elements 

---
